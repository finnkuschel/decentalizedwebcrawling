With this iExec application you are going to be able to fetch website data onto your smart contract in case a website doesn't provide an api.

ROADMAP:
- pass website url and specific css selectors as an argument to look for and return their innerhtml 
- make this app web 3.0 compatible; let users switch between sites, enable users to do logins, etc.
- build a decentralized escrow service on top of this
